        <h2>From Strangers to Innovators</h2>
<p>In our first semester at Audencia Business School, Nantes, I (Austin) faced significant challenges navigating the
    school’s online portal. As a laid-back backbencher, I often struggled to keep up with class updates and
    deadlines.<br><br>
    This inconvenience sparked an idea. As I got familiarized with voice assistants like ChatGPT, I began to envision a
    solution that could streamline these everyday hassles. The tipping point came when I was left to sift through
    countless emails and web pages to gather necessary information for a finance exam, leading to a eureka moment: there
    had to be a better way.<br><br>
    Realizing this was a widespread problem, I discussed the idea with Ashrith and DhanushVardhan from NIT Trichy.
    Together, we decided to create a virtual assistant tailored to the needs of students, one that could simplify access
    to information and improve the overall academic experience.<br><br>
    Our search for technical expertise led us to Ashrith and DhanushVardhan, who shared our enthusiasm and vision. With
    their technical prowess and our practical insights, we embarked on a journey to develop a robust virtual assistant
    for educational institutions.<br><br>
    Today, we are proud to announce our readiness to equip 1,000 schools with our innovative solution by June 2025. Our
    virtual assistant is designed to transform the student experience, making it more efficient, convenient, and
    enjoyable.<br><br>
    Welcome to our journey—where classroom frustrations fuel transformative innovation, and where a shared vision turns
    into a reality that benefits thousands.</p>
